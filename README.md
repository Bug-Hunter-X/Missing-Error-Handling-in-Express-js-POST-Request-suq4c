# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  missing error handling for missing or malformed request bodies in POST requests.

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js server that handles POST requests to `/users`. It attempts to access `req.body`, but lacks error handling for cases where the request body is missing or improperly formatted. This can lead to unexpected crashes or silent failures.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, demonstrating robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks and providing appropriate responses to the client when errors occur.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
4. Run `node bug.js`.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` without a body or with an improperly formatted body (e.g., sending text instead of JSON).

You'll observe that the original code crashes or behaves unexpectedly, while the solution handles the error gracefully.

## Solution

Always validate and handle potential errors when processing request bodies in Express.js to prevent unexpected application behavior.  The solution uses `try...catch` blocks to explicitly catch errors related to accessing `req.body` and provide helpful error responses to the client.
